<h1> Capital City Project </h1>

<h3> What does the Program Do and Why would you want to use it? </h3>
     <li>The program essentially starts by asking the user if they want to find a capital city based of a Country or based of an Australian State.</li>
     <li>The program then proceeds to scrape the capital city's of a webpage, store it in a list, find the country or state and display it's capital city.</li>
     <li>The program is not too pragamatic to be used in the real world, I have made it for my own learning and development purposes.</li>


<h3> How to Build the Program? </h3>

```Ensure you have Python Installed ```

The requirements to run the program can be achieved by running the following commands in your respective OS terminal:

``` pip install requests ```

```pip install beautifulsoup4```

<h3> How to execute the program? </h3>

<h4> Method 1 </h4>

Simply just open the ```capital_city.py``` file in an IDE, execute and apply the respective inputs

<h4> Method 2 (Windows/Linux) </h4>

Open your terminal in the directory where the ```capital_city.py``` file is located, type and execute the following in the terminal ```python3 capital_city.py```

<h3> My motivation and Learning Experience from this Project </h3>

I made this project to gain awareness and create a new skillset for myself regarding web scraping using Python. This my first time using webscraping.

I chose to use webscraping in this project because of the dynamicness it can provide, because if captial city names are changed it's updated on the website, thus requiring no local configuration from my end. 

I learnt about the basic webscraping libraries and their funtionalities. Furthermore, it also gave me insight on how to examine HTML Pages when wanting to scrape infromation.

I want to further expand these skillsets, look into further complex webscraping tools and build other projects that use webscraping tools.
